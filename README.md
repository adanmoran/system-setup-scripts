## system-setup-scripts

This repository contains scripts that are used to install system utilities that
I use regularly. Some are installed through the package manager, and others are
downloaded and built from source by the scripts. Currently, these scripts work
and are tested on Ubuntu 14.04. Many also work on Ubuntu 16.04.

### Installation

All tools may be installed with the following command, run as root. (Note: Do
not execute anything as root unless you know where it's from and trust what it
will do)

```shell
bash -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmdaly/system-setup-scripts/master/tools/setup.sh -O -)"
```
