## system-setup-scripts

This repository contains scripts that are used to install system utilities that I use and are not available in the package manager.

### Installation

All tools may be installed with the following command,

```shell
bash -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmdaly/system-setup-scripts/master/tools/setup.sh -O -)"
```
